I am a web developer currenlty working for Giraffes in the Kitchen, a digital agency in Greece. 

This is the place where I document and share my projects or other findings from daily issues/bugs.

My current stack is: PHP, MySQL, Apache and a lot of Javascript.

You can check some of my projects on my [github](https://github.com/konmavrakis) profile or you can follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/konmavrakis)
